    "### **Components Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stateless Functional Component**\n",
    "\n",
    "Are JavaScript regular Functions. Should return `Jsx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Js\n",
    "\n",
    "import React from 'react';\n",

    "    return <h1>Hello Birat!</h1>\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stateful Class Component**\n",
    "\n",
    "Are ES6 `Class` that extends the component class from JavaScript. Should contain a `render` method that returns `HTML`. Optionally received `props`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, class components can maintain `internal state` of the component which private to the component.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Js\n",
    "\n",
    "// Welcome.jsx\n",
    "\n",
    "import React, { Component } from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "class Welcome extends Component {\n",
    "    render() {\n",

    "import Welcome from './components/Welcome'\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To create `Class Component` the component class should extend `Component`. It should contain `render` method which should return `JSX`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **But, when to use Class Component and Functional Component?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functional Component**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use functional component when possible beacuse if we use `Class Component` the maintainces of multiple state that comes with it becomes very difficult for a beginner.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Functional Components do not have their `internal state` they are called `stateless`. But, with the emergence of `Hooks` functional components are also `stateful`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class Component**\n",
    "\n",
    "They are more feature rich.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used to handle complex UI logic. Maintain their own private data i.e. `state`. Because of this they are called `stateful` components.\n",
    "\n",
    "They provide lifecycle hooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is JSX?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's just sugar coating of HTML that supports JavaScript. To use JSX we need to use `{}`. Inside the curly braces we can use any JavaScript expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Atributes in JSX**\n",
    "\n",

    "We've four phases in `React Component Lifecycle`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mounting Phase**\n",
    "\n",
    "When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM, the following methods are called in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. `constructor()` : It's called before the component is mounted. It's used for initializing state and binding event handlers. It does not cause side effects like making API calls. Calls the `super(props)` to initialize the parent class with props.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2. `static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state)` : It's called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM. It enables a component to update its state based on changes in props over time. It returns an object to update the state or null to update nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It being `static` means it doesn't have access to `this` keyword. We've to return the updated state object and then set the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3. `render()`: It's the only required method in a class component. It examines `this.props` and `this.state` and returns one of the following types: `React elements`, `arrays` and `fragments`, portals, string and numbers, booleans or null.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should not modify the component state or interact with the browser (e.g., by using `setTimeout` or making API calls) inside this method. It should be a pure function of props and state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4. `componentDidMount()`: It will be only called once in the whole lifecycle of a component. It's invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the tree). It's a good place to initiate network requests, set up subscriptions, or interact with the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Updating Phase**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state, the following methods are called in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. `static getDerivedStateFromProps()`: It's called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM. It enables a component to update its state based on changes in props over time. It returns an object to update the state or null to update nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2. `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`: It receives the `updated` `props` and `state` as arguments. It returns a boolean value that determines whether the component should re-render or not. By default, it returns `true`. We can use this method to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it returns `true`, the update process continues, and the component re-renders. If it returns `false`, the update process is halted, and the component does not re-render.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does not cause any side effects like making API calls or interacting with the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3. `render()`: It's the only required method in a class component. It examines `this.props` and `this.state` and returns one of the following types: `React elements`, `arrays` and `fragments`, portals, string and numbers, booleans or null.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `render()` method is called to actually update the `DOM` with the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4. `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`: It receives the previous `props` and `state` as arguments. It is called right before the changes from the `Virtual DOM` are to be reflected in the `DOM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It captures some information from the `DOM` such as `Scroll Position` before it is potentially changed, so that when the update is applied, we can use that information to adjust the `DOM` accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value returned from this method is passed as a third parameter to `componentDidUpdate()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we don't need to capture any information, we can return `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 5. `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)`: It is invoked immediately after the `render` is committed to the `DOM`. It receives the previous `props` and `state` as arguments. The third parameter, `snapshot`, is the value returned from `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function will executes only once per re-render cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is where we can perform side effects, such as making network requests, interacting with the `DOM`, or updating the state based on the previous `props` or `state`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unmounting Phase**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a component is being removed from the DOM, the following method is called:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. `componentWillUnmount()` : It is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed. It is used to perform any necessary cleanup, such as invalidating timers, canceling network requests, or cleaning up subscriptions that were created in `componentDidMount()`.\n",
