    "## **Notes About React Life Cycle**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before, `Hooks` we used to control `React Life Cycle` manually using `Class Component`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To control `state` we used `this.state` and to update the state we used `this.setState()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To control life cycle methods we used `componentDidMount()`, `componentDidUpdate()`, `componentWillUnmount()` etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To use `props` we used `this.props`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, after hooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can use `state` using `useState()` hook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can control life cycle methods using `useEffect()` hook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can use `useMemo()` hook to memoize values\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use `useEffect(() => {}, [])` to mimic `componentDidMount()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use `useEffect(() => {}, [var])` to mimic `componentDidUpdate()`\n",

    "### **Lifecycle Methods in Class Component**\n",
    "\n",
    "We've four phases in `React Component Lifecycle`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mounting Phase**\n",
    "\n",
    "When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM, the following methods are called in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. `constructor()` : It's called before the component is mounted. It's used for initializing state and binding event handlers. It does not cause side effects like making API calls. Calls the `super(props)` to initialize the parent class with props.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2. `static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state)` : It's called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM. It enables a component to update its state based on changes in props over time. It returns an object to update the state or null to update nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It being `static` means it doesn't have access to `this` keyword. We've to return the updated state object and then set the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3. `render()`: It's the only required method in a class component. It examines `this.props` and `this.state` and returns one of the following types: `React elements`, `arrays` and `fragments`, portals, string and numbers, booleans or null.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should not modify the component state or interact with the browser (e.g., by using `setTimeout` or making API calls) inside this method. It should be a pure function of props and state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4. `componentDidMount()`: It will be only called once in the whole lifecycle of a component. It's invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the tree). It's a good place to initiate network requests, set up subscriptions, or interact with the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Updating Phase**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state, the following methods are called in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. `static getDerivedStateFromProps()`: It's called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM. It enables a component to update its state based on changes in props over time. It returns an object to update the state or null to update nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2. `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`: It receives the `updated` `props` and `state` as arguments. It returns a boolean value that determines whether the component should re-render or not. By default, it returns `true`. We can use this method to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it returns `true`, the update process continues, and the component re-renders. If it returns `false`, the update process is halted, and the component does not re-render.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does not cause any side effects like making API calls or interacting with the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3. `render()`: It's the only required method in a class component. It examines `this.props` and `this.state` and returns one of the following types: `React elements`, `arrays` and `fragments`, portals, string and numbers, booleans or null.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should not modify the component state or interact with the browser (e.g., by using `setTimeout` or making API calls) inside this method. It should be a pure function of props and state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `render()` method is called to actually update the `DOM` with the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4. `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`: It receives the previous `props` and `state` as arguments. It is called right before the changes from the `Virtual DOM` are to be reflected in the `DOM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It captures some information from the `DOM` such as `Scroll Position` before it is potentially changed, so that when the update is applied, we can use that information to adjust the `DOM` accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value returned from this method is passed as a third parameter to `componentDidUpdate()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we don't need to capture any information, we can return `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 5. `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)`: It is invoked immediately after the `render` is committed to the `DOM`. It receives the previous `props` and `state` as arguments. The third parameter, `snapshot`, is the value returned from `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function will executes only once per re-render cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is where we can perform side effects, such as making network requests, interacting with the `DOM`, or updating the state based on the previous `props` or `state`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unmounting Phase**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a component is being removed from the DOM, the following method is called:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. `componentWillUnmount()` : It is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed. It is used to perform any necessary cleanup, such as invalidating timers, canceling network requests, or cleaning up subscriptions that were created in `componentDidMount()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should not call `setState()` in this method, as the component will no longer be mounted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error Handling Phase**\n",
    "\n",
    "When there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component, the following methods are called in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. `static getDerivedStateFromError(error)` : This method is called when an error is during `rendering`, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.\n",
    "\n",
    "It receives the error that was thrown as a parameter and returns an object to update the state. This allows us to render a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.\n",
    "\n",

    "## **React Life Cycle After `Fiber` Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Fiber` is the new reconciliation algorithm in `React 16` and later versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before `Fiber`, React used a stack-based algorithm for reconciliation, which started from the root of the component tree and worked its way down to the leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach could lead to performance issues, especially with large component trees, as it could block the main thread for extended periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**After Fiber Implementation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- React breaks the rendering work into smaller units called \"fibers.\" Each fiber represents a component and its associated state and props.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each `Fiber` represents one component in the tree. It contains information about the component's type, props, state, and its relationship to other fibers (parent, child, sibling).\n",
    "\n",
    "- React can pause and resume work on fibers, allowing it to prioritize more urgent updates (like user interactions) over less urgent ones (like rendering offscreen components).\n",
    "\n",
    "- React can work on multiple fibers in a single frame, allowing it to make progress on rendering even if it can't complete the entire tree in one go.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, `Fiber` allowed `React` to become `Asynchronous` and `Interruptible`, leading to improved performance and responsiveness, especially in complex applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **React Working of Lifecycle Methods After `Fiber`**\n",
    "\n",
    "React `Fiber` or the new reconciliation algorithm introduced in React 16 has two main phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Render Phase (Reconciliation Phase)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Builds or Updates the `Fiber` tree or `Virtual DOM` tree based on changes in `state` or `props`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It compares old `Fiber` tree with the new `Fiber` tree to determine what has changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It can be paused, aborted, or restarted. This means that if a high-priority update comes in (like a user interaction), React can pause the current work and handle the high-priority update first.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This phase has `Side Effects`. It means that during this phase, React can prepare changes to be made to the `DOM`, but it does not actually touch the real `DOM` yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this phase, `React` calls the following lifecycle methods:\n",

    "**Note:**\n",

    "- Use `Hooks` at top level of the component.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Only call `Hooks` from `React Function Component` or from `Custom Hook` not from regular `JavaScript` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we need to update the state based on the `previous state`, then we should use the `callback` function as parameter to the `setState` function. Also, we should always `return` the new state from the `callback` function, else `undefined` will be set as the new state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we've `Object` or `Array` as state, then we should always use the `spread operator` to copy the previous state and then update the specific property of the state.
