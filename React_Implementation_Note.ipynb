    "### `useState` Hook\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is used to manage the state in `Functional Component`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It returns an `Array` of two elements. The first element is the current state value and the second element is the function that is used to update the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can pass the initial state value to `useState` as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The state update function can take either the new state value or a callback function that receives the previous state value and returns the new state value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the state is updated, the component re-renders.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### `useEffect` Hook\n",
    "\n",
    "- It runs on every render by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we pass `[]` as a second argument, it runs only on `Component Mount`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we pass `[props, state]` as a second argument, it runs only when the `props` or `state` change.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CleanUpFunction**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the callback that we return from the `callback` function passed to `useEffect`.\n",

    "- It runs before `Component Mount` and before every `Re-Render`. It cleans the side effects created by the previous render.\n",
    "\n",

    "### **`useRef` Hook**\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is used to access the `DOM` elements directly. It is excatly as `document.getElementById()` in `JavaScript`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It can also be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It returns a mutable `ref` object which has a property called `current`. We can access the `DOM` element using this `current` property.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We need to attach the `ref` object to the `JSX` element using the `ref` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `ref` object is persisted for the full lifetime of the component.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It does not notify when its content changes. Mutating the `.current` property does not cause a re-render.\n",

    "If we've attach `ref` to an `input` element, then `ref.current` will point to that `input` element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can access the `styles` and `attributes` of that `input` element using `ref.current._property_name`.\n",
