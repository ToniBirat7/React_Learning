    "## **Notes About React Life Cycle**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before, `Hooks` we used to control `React Life Cycle` manually using `Class Component`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To control `state` we used `this.state` and to update the state we used `this.setState()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To control life cycle methods we used `componentDidMount()`, `componentDidUpdate()`, `componentWillUnmount()` etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To use `props` we used `this.props`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, after hooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can use `state` using `useState()` hook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can control life cycle methods using `useEffect()` hook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can use `useMemo()` hook to memoize values\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use `useEffect(() => {}, [])` to mimic `componentDidMount()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use `useEffect(() => {}, [var])` to mimic `componentDidUpdate()`\n",

    "\n",
    "We've four phases in `React Component Lifecycle`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mounting Phase**\n",
    "\n",
    "When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM, the following methods are called in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. `constructor()` : It's called before the component is mounted. It's used for initializing state and binding event handlers. It does not cause side effects like making API calls. Calls the `super(props)` to initialize the parent class with props.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2. `static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state)` : It's called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM. It enables a component to update its state based on changes in props over time. It returns an object to update the state or null to update nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It being `static` means it doesn't have access to `this` keyword. We've to return the updated state object and then set the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3. `render()`: It's the only required method in a class component. It examines `this.props` and `this.state` and returns one of the following types: `React elements`, `arrays` and `fragments`, portals, string and numbers, booleans or null.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should not modify the component state or interact with the browser (e.g., by using `setTimeout` or making API calls) inside this method. It should be a pure function of props and state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4. `componentDidMount()`: It will be only called once in the whole lifecycle of a component. It's invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the tree). It's a good place to initiate network requests, set up subscriptions, or interact with the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Updating Phase**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state, the following methods are called in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. `static getDerivedStateFromProps()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2. `shouldComponentUpdate()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3. `render()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4. `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- 5. `componentDidUpdate()`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unmounting Phase**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a component is being removed from the DOM, the following method is called:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. `componentWillUnmount()`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error Handling Phase**\n",
    "\n",
    "When there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component, the following methods are called in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. `static getDerivedStateFromError()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2. `componentDidCatch()`\n",

    "\n",
    "- It is used to manage the state in `Functional Component`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
