    "### **Components Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stateless Functional Component**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Are JavaScript regular Functions. Should return `Jsx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Js\n",
    "\n",
    "import React from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "export const Greet = () => {\n",
    "    return <h1>Hello Birat!</h1>\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stateful Class Component**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Are ES6 `Class` that extends the component class from JavaScript. Should contain a `render` method that returns `HTML`. Optionally received `props`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Also, class components can maintain `internal state` of the component which private to the component. \n",
    "\n",
    "```Js\n",
    "\n",
    "// Welcome.jsx\n",
    "\n",
    "import React, { Component } from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "class Welcome extends Component {\n",
    "    render() {\n",
    "        return <h1>Class Component</h1>\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "export default Welcome;\n",
    "\n",
    "// App.jsx\n",
    "\n",
    "import { Greet } from './components/Greet'\n",
    "import Welcome from './components/Welcome'\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To create `Class Component` the component class should extend `Component`. It should contain `render` method which should return `JSX`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **But, when to use Class Component and Functional Component?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functional Component**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use functional component when possible beacuse if we use `Class Component` the maintainces of multiple state that comes with it becomes very difficult for a beginner. \n",
    "\n",
    "As Functional Components do not have their `internal state` they are called `stateless`. But, with the emergence of `Hooks` functional components are also `stateful`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class Component**\n",
    "\n",
    "They are more feature rich. \n",
    "\n",
    "Used to handle complex UI logic. Maintain their own private data i.e. `state`. Because of this they are called `stateful` components.\n",
    "\n",
    "They provide lifecycle hooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is JSX?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's just sugar coating of HTML that supports JavaScript. To use JSX we need to use `{}`. Inside the curly braces we can use any JavaScript expressions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Atributes in JSX**\n",
    "\n",
    "`class` : className\n",
    "`for` : htmlFor\n",
    "`onclick` : onClick\n",
    "`tabindex` : tabIndex"
