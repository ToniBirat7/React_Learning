    "## **Understanding How React Works Behind the Scenes**\n",
    "\n",
    "First we've to understand the difference between `React Components`, `React Elements`, and `Components Instances`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **React Elements**\n",
    "\n",
    "`React Elements` are the smallest building blocks of `React` applications. They are plain JavaScript objects that represent a DOM node or a component instance. `React Elements` are created using the `React.createElement()` method or by using `JSX` syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "// Functional Component\n",
    "const MyComponent = (props) => {\n",
    "  return <div>{props.message}</div>;\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For us `MyComponent` is a React Element. But for `React`, it's just a function that returns an `Object` (React Element). If we console log it, we will see that it returns an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "console.log(MyComponent({ message: \"Hello, World!\" }));\n",
    "// Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"$$typeof\": Symbol.for(\"react.element\"),\n",
    "  type: \"div\",\n",
    "  props: { children: 'Hello, World!' },\n",
    "  key: null,\n",
    "  ref: null\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Exactly Happens to a React Element When We Use It in JSX?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use a React Element in JSX, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "<MyComponent message=\"Hello, World!\" />\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. JSX Transformation:** The `JSX` syntax get converted into many nested `React.createElement` calls by a tool like Babel. The above JSX code is transformed into:\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "const MyComponent = (props) => {\n",
    "  return React.createElement(\"div\", null, props.message);\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see the equivalent code for `JSX` by\\* using the [Babel REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Each `React.createElement` call creates a `React Element` object.** The `React.createElement` function takes three arguments: the type of the element (e.g., \"div\" or a component), the props (attributes) for the element, and the children (nested elements or text).\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **React Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "`React Component` is a class or a function outputs an `Element Tree`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it is a class component, it extends `React.Component` and must have a `render()` method that returns a `React Element`. If it is a functional component, it is simply a function that returns a `React Element`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "// Class Component\n",
    "class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n",
    "  render() {\n",
    "    return <div>{this.props.message}</div>;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Functional Component\n",
    "const MyComponent = (props) => {\n",
    "  return <div>{props.message}</div>;\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Is The Difference Between Calling a React Component i.e. `console.log(MyComponent())` and `console.log(<MyComponent />)`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we call a `React Component` directly, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "console.log(MyComponent({ message: \"Hello, World!\" }));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We are invoking the component function and passing props to it. This will return a an `Object` (React Element). If we console log it, we will see that it returns an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"$$typeof\": Symbol.for(\"react.element\"),\n",
    "  type: \"div\",\n",
    "  props: { children: 'Hello, World!' },\n",
    "  key: null,\n",
    "  ref: null\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But when we use `<MyComponent />` it returns an `Object` (React Element) that represents the component instance. This `Object` contains information about the component type, props, and children.\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"$$typeof\": Symbol(\"react.element\"),\n",
    "  type: (props) => { ... },\n",
    "  props: { message: 'Hello, World!' },\n",
    "  key: null,\n",
    "  ref: null\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can notice that the `type` property is different in both cases. In the first case, it is a string `\"div\"`, while in the second case, it is a function (the component itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when we use `<MyComponent />` inside JSX, `React` knows to treat it as a component and will eventually call the arrow function defined in the `type` property to get the `React Element` tree that it returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Component Instances**\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Component Instance` is a specific occurrence of a `React Component` that is created when the component is rendered. Each time a component is rendered, a new instance of that component is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use a `React Component` in JSX, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "<MyComponent message=\"Hello, World!\" />\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`React` creates a new `Component Instance` for `MyComponent`. This instance has its own state and props, and it can manage its own lifecycle methods (if it's a class component).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of a `Component Instance` as a specific \"copy\" of the component that is created when it is rendered. Each instance can have its own state and props, allowing for multiple instances of the same component to exist independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when a `React Element` describes a `React Component`, `React` keeps track of it and creates a `Component Instance` when it is rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each `Component Instance` is unique and can have its own state and props, allowing for dynamic and interactive user interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can access those `states` and `props` using `this.state` and `this.props` in class components, and directly using `props` and `useState` hook in functional components.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **React Elements** are plain JavaScript objects that represent a DOM node or a component instance. They are created using `React.createElement()` or `JSX` syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **React Components** are classes or functions that return `React Elements`. They can be class components (extending `React.Component`) or functional components (simple functions).\n",

    "## **Understanding `Reconciliation` in React**\n",
    "\n",
    "We understood that all `React` does is create a tree of elements for our components.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of creating `Tree` of `ELements` is very fast, because `React Elements` are just plain `JavaScript Objects`. And, we can create thousands of them in a fraction of a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "`React` will convert the `JSX` code i.e. `Components` into `React Elements` using `Babel` or similar tools. This will generate a `Tree` of `React Elements` for our entire application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Virtual DOM`**\n",
    "\n",
    "`React` keeps this `Tree` in memory, which is called the `Virtual DOM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Acual DOM`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Actual DOM` is the real representation of the UI in the browser. It is a tree-like structure that represents the HTML elements on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we first render our `React` application, `React` will create the `Virtual DOM` and then it will create the `Actual DOM` based on the `Virtual DOM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mounting**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the `Tree` of `React Elements` is created, `React` has to insert the `Tree` or `Virtual DOM` into the `Actual DOM`. This process is called `Mounting`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making those kinds of adjustments to the `Actual DOM` is a slow process, because the `Actual DOM` is a complex structure that requires a lot of processing power to update.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, on the initial render, `React` will create the entire `Tree` of `React Elements` in memory, and then it will create the `Actual DOM` based on the `Virtual DOM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**But**, what if `Tree` of `React Elements` changes? For example, if there is a state change which results into a different return value and elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this, case a new `Tree` of `React Elements` will be created in memory. Now, `React` has to figure out what has changed between the previous `Tree` and the new `Tree`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, `React` could just render the `Actual DOM` from the new `Tree React Elements`. But that would be very inefficient, as it would require a lot of processing power to create the entire `Actual DOM` from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, `React` uses a process called `Reconciliation` to figure out what has changed between the previous `Tree` and the new `Tree`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses an algorithm called the `Diffing Algorithm` to compare the two `Trees` and figure out what has changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Diffing Algorithm` works by comparing the two `Trees` node by node. It will compare the `type`, `props`, and `children` of each node to see if they are the same or different. Also, we should provide a `key` prop to each element in a list to help `React` identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Diffing Algorithm Operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Diffing Algorithm` can perform three operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Update:** If the `type` of the node is the same, but the `props` or `children` are different, then `React` will update the node in the `Actual DOM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a `div` with a `className` of `old-class` and we change it to `new-class`, then `React` will update the `className` of the `div` in the `Actual DOM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "// Previous Tree\n",
    "<div className=\"old-class\">Hello, World!</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "// New Tree\n",
    "<div className=\"new-class\">Hello, World!</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `type` of the node is the same (`div`), but the `props` (`className`) are different. Therefore, `React` will update the `className` of the `div` in the `Actual DOM`. Not the entire `div` will be re-rendered, only the `className` will be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the component instance in the `Old Tree` will be reused in the `New Tree`. The same instance will be updated with the new props and state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is when the `children node` changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we've a `<ul>` with two `<li>` elements and we add a third `<li>`, then `React` will update the `Actual DOM` to include the new `<li>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "// Previous Tree\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>Item 1</li>\n",
    "  <li>Item 2</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "// New Tree\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>Item 3</li>\n",
    "  <li>Item 1</li>\n",
    "  <li>Item 2</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above we've added a new `<li>` to the beginning of the list. In such case, `React` will create a entire new `Tree` from that node downwars because the order of the children has changed and there's no way to match the old children with the new children.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if there had been `1000` items in the list, `React` would have to re-render all `1000` items because the order has changed. This would be very inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it's important to provide a `key` prop to each element in a list to help `React` identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "// Previous Tree\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li key=\"1\">Item 1</li>\n",
    "  <li key=\"2\">Item 2</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "// New Tree\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li key=\"3\">Item 3</li>\n",
    "  <li key=\"1\">Item 1</li>\n",
    "  <li key=\"2\">Item 2</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now as the `key` prop is provided, `React` can identify that `Item 1` and `Item 2` are the same items and only `Item 3` is new. Therefore, it will only create a new node for `Item 3` in the `Actual DOM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But remember the `Key` should be unique and stable. It should not change between renders. Using indexes as keys can lead to issues when the list changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, do not use `index` as `key` if the order of items may change.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create:** If the `type` of the node is different, then `React` will create a new node in the `Actual DOM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a `div` and we change it to a `span`, then `React` will create a new `span` in the `Actual DOM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "// Previous Tree\n",
    "<div>Hello, World!</div>\n",
    "// New Tree\n",
    "<span>Hello, World!</span>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `type` of the node is different (`div` vs `span`). Therefore, `React` will rebuild the `Tree` from that node downwards and create a new `span` in the `Actual DOM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, all the component instance in the `Old Tree` from that node downwards will be unmounted and new component instances will be created in the `New Tree`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Delete:** If a node is present in the previous `Tree` but not in the new `Tree`, then `React` will delete that node from the `Actual DOM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a `div` and we remove it, then `React` will delete the `div` from the `Actual DOM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "// Previous Tree\n",
    "<div>Hello, World!</div>\n",
    "// New Tree\n",
    "// (div is removed)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `div` is present in the previous `Tree` but not in the new `Tree`. Therefore, `React` will delete the `div` from the `Actual DOM`.\n",

    "## **Understanding `Rendering` in React**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Rendering` is the process of converting the `React Elements` into `Actual DOM` elements that can be displayed in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Rendering` is handled by `Packages` like `ReactDOM` for web applications and `React Native` for mobile applications. These packages are called `Renderers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we first render our `React` application, `React` will create the `Virtual DOM` and then it will create the `Actual DOM` based on the `Virtual DOM`. This process is called `Mounting`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When there is a state change or props change, a new `Tree` of `React Elements` will be created in memory. Now, `React` has to figure out what has changed between the previous `Tree` and the new `Tree`. This process is called `Reconciliation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "`React` is just a library that allows us to define `Component` `Elements` and manage their `state` and `props` and it does the `Diffing` part. It does not handle the actual rendering of the `Elements` to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the actual implementation details of how the `Elements` are rendered to the screen are handled by the `Renderers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use `React` for web development, `React` does not even know that the elements will be rendered to the web browser. `React` is therefore compatible with any `Renderer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we can create our own custom `Renderer` using the `react-test-renderer` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **`Renderers`**\n",
    "\n",
    "They begin the `Reconciliation` process by creating a new `Virtual DOM` tree based on the updated `React Elements`. Then, they use the `Diffing Algorithm` to compare the new `Virtual DOM` tree with the previous one and determine the minimal set of changes required to update the `Actual DOM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the changes are determined, the `Renderers` apply those changes to the `Actual DOM`, updating only the parts of the DOM that have changed. This process is optimized to minimize the number of updates to the DOM, which can be a slow operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "In actual web development, we only import `ReactDOM` once and call it's `render(<Component/>, document.getElementById('root'))` method to mount our root component to the `Actual DOM`. After that, `ReactDOM` takes care of the `Reconciliation` and `Rendering` process whenever there is a state or props change in our components.\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "import React from \"react\";\n",
    "import ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\n",
    "import App from \"./App\";\n",
    "\n",
    "ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById(\"root\"));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to understand that `React` communicates with the `Renderers` i.e. `ReactDOM` to perform the `Reconciliation` and `Rendering` process. The `Renderers` are responsible for updating the `Actual DOM` based on the changes in the `Virtual DOM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Understanding How `React` Communicates with `Renderers` By Using `Hooks`**\n",
    "\n",
    "`React` provides a set of `Hooks` that allow us to manage the state and lifecycle of our components. These `Hooks` are functions that can be called inside functional components to add stateful logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use `Hooks` like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc., `React` keeps track of the state and lifecycle of our components. When the state or props of a component change, `React` triggers a re-render of the component.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this re-render, `React` creates a new `Tree` of `React Elements` based on the updated state and props. It then uses the `Diffing Algorithm` to compare the new `Tree` with the previous `Tree` and determine what has changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the changes are determined, `React` communicates with the `Renderers` (like `ReactDOM`) to apply those changes to the `Actual DOM`. The `Renderers` then update the `Actual DOM` based on the changes provided by `React`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Re-Rendering Process with Hooks**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State or Props Change:** When the state or props of a component change (e.g., through `useState` or `useEffect`), `React` marks the component as needing to be re-rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Creating New Tree:** `React` creates a new `Tree` of `React Elements` based on the updated state and props.\n",

    "\n",
    "`Fiber` in `React` is just plain `JavaScript Object` with some properties that represents a unit of work in the `React` rendering process.\n",

    "`Fiber` focuses on `Animations` and `Responsiveness`. It allows `React` to pause and resume work on the `Virtual DOM` tree, which is especially useful for handling complex animations and interactions.\n",

    "The `Stack` `Reconciliation` algorithm is a synchronous algorithm that processes the entire `Virtual DOM` tree in a single pass. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of the nodes that need to be processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a component's state or props change, the `Stack` `Reconciliation` algorithm starts at the root of the `Virtual DOM` tree and traverses down to the leaves, comparing each node in the new tree with the corresponding node in the old tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "It had to work until the `Stack` which keeps track of the `nodes` to be processed is empty. This means that the entire `Virtual DOM` tree must be processed in a single pass, which can lead to performance issues when dealing with large and complex component trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of Stack Reconciliation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we've a text field, ideally we would like to type in the text field without any delay. But what if there's some network request happening in the background, or some other heavy computation happening in the background that results into some elements being `Rendered` on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we type into the text field, while those elements are being `Rendered`, the `Stack` `Reconciliation` algorithm has to process the entire `Virtual DOM` tree, which can lead to a delay in typing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "function App() {\n",
    "  const [text, setText] = React.useState(\"\");\n",
    "  const [items, setItems] = React.useState(Array(1000).fill(0));\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "      <input value={text} onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} />\n",
    "      <ul>\n",
    "        {items.map((item, index) => (\n",
    "          <li key={index}>Item {index}</li>\n",
    "        ))}\n",
    "      </ul>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, we've a text field and a list of `1000` items. When we type in the text field, the `Stack` `Reconciliation` algorithm has to process the entire `Virtual DOM` tree, which can lead to a delay in typing.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means for each keystroke, the entire list of `1000` items has to be re-rendered, which can cause a noticeable lag in the user interface. This is because the `Stack` `Reconciliation` algorithm processes the entire tree in a single pass, and it cannot pause or interrupt the work to prioritize more important tasks, such as user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, **Stack was `Synchronous` and That Was a Problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get back to `Fiber`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Fiber` also represents a unit of work in the `React` rendering process. `React` first processes those `Fibers` i.e. Small units of work and once the work is done i.e. `Finished Work`, it `commits` the changes to the `Actual DOM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This all happens in two `Phases`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Render Phase (Processing):** In this phase, `React` creates a new `Fiber` tree based on the updated `React Elements`. It uses the `Diffing Algorithm` to compare the new `Fiber` tree with the previous one and determine the minimal set of changes required to update the `Actual DOM`. This phase is `Asynchronous` and `Interruptible`, which means that it can pause and resume work as needed, allowing `React` to prioritize more important work, such as user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this phase, internal functions like `beginWork`, `completeWork`, and `performUnitOfWork` are used to process each `Fiber` node. The `beginWork` function is responsible for starting the work on a `Fiber` node, while the `completeWork` function is responsible for completing the work on a `Fiber` node. The `performUnitOfWork` function is responsible for performing the work on a single `Fiber` node.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we take the above example of text field and list of `1000` items, when we type in the text field, the `Fiber` `Render Phase` can pause the work of processing the list of `1000` items and prioritize the work of updating the text field. This allows us to type in the text field without any delay, even if there are other heavy computations happening in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Commit Phase (Applying Changes):** In this phase, `React` applies the changes determined in the `Render Phase` to the `Actual DOM`. This phase is `Synchronous` and cannot be interrupted. It ensures that the `Actual DOM` is updated in a consistent and predictable manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this phase, internal functions like `commitRoot`, `commitWork`, and `commitPlacement` are used to apply the changes to the `Actual DOM`. The `commitRoot` function is responsible for committing the changes to the root of the `Fiber` tree, while the `commitWork` function is responsible for committing the changes to a specific `Fiber` node. The `commitPlacement` function is responsible for placing a new node in the `Actual DOM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **`Fiber` Properties**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Fiber` always has `one-to-one` relationship with a `\"something\"` that can be `Instance of React Component`, `DOM Node`, or `Text Node`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `tag` property stores the `typeof` `\"something\"` i.e. it can be a number form `0-24` representing different `Fiber` types such as `FunctionComponent = 0`, `ClassComponent = 1`, `HostComponent = 5` (for DOM nodes like `div`, `span`, etc.), `HostText = 6` (for text nodes), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `stateNode` property holds a reference to the actual instance of the `\"something\"` that the `Fiber` represents. For example, if the `Fiber` represents a `DOM Node`, then `stateNode` will hold a reference to the actual `DOM Node`. `React` uses this property to access the `State` and `Props` of the component instance or to manipulate the `DOM Node`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the Difference Between `React Element` and `Fiber`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's natural to confuse `React Element` with `Fiber`, as `Fiber` are also plain `JavaScript Objects` that represent a unit of work in the `React` rendering process. However, they serve different purposes in the `React` architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Fibers` are often created from `React Elements` during the `Render Phase` of the `Fiber` architecture. Each `Fiber` corresponds to a specific `React Element` and contains additional information needed for the `Reconciliation` process, such as the `tag`, `stateNode`, and pointers to parent, child, and sibling `Fibers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- But, `React Elements` are re-created every time, `Fibers` are persistent and can be reused across renders. Each time a component is rendered, a new `Fiber` tree is created, but the `Fibers` themselves can be reused if the corresponding `React Elements` have not changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most `Fibers` are created during the `intial mount`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**More Fiber Properties:**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know `Fibers` have one to one relationship with a `\"something\"` that can be `Instance of React Component`, `DOM Node`, or `Text Node`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, each `Fiber` has relationship with other `Fibers` in the tree structure. Each `Fiber` has a `parent`, `child`, `sibling` and `return` property that points to the corresponding `Fiber` nodes in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>\n",
    "  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `Fiber` for the `div` element will have a `child` property that points to the `Fiber` for the `h1` element, and the `Fiber` for the `h1` element will have a `sibling` property that points to the `Fiber` for the `p` element.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Fiber` for the `div` element will also have a `parent` property that points to the `Fiber` for the root of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "And `return` property will always point to the `parent` `Fiber`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary (Till Now)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a tree of connected `Fibers` that represents the entire `React` application.\n",

    "### **Understanding `Work` in React Fiber**\n",
    "\n",
    "So what exactly is `Work` in `React Fiber`?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whenever there's a state change in a component, `React` creates a new `Fiber` tree in memory. `Work` is the process of updating this `Fiber` tree based on changes in state or props.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whenever there is `Lifecycle` method such as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, or `componentWillUnmount` in class components, or `useEffect` hook in functional to be called, there is some `Work` to be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Changes in the `DOM` is also considered as `Work`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can say that `Work` depends on the changes that need to be made to the `Fiber` tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Work can be handled directly or `Scheduled` for later.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Work can be splitted into smaller chunks, by using `timeSlicing` technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `High Priority Work` such as user interactions can be prioritized over `Low Priority Work` such as rendering a list of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `Work` like `animations` can be `Scheduled` in such a way they are handled `ASP`A (As Soon As Possible) without blocking the main thread. `requestAnimationFrame` API can be used to schedule `Work` and it has a high priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, if some `Work` is not important, such as `Network Requests`, it can be `Scheduled` to be handled `INP` (In Next Paint) or even later. `setTimeout` API can be used to schedule `Work` and it has a low priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Understanding `Fiber Tree`**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of `Fiber Trees`:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Fiber Tree**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tree represents the current state of the application. It is the tree that is currently being rendered to the `Actual DOM`. This tree is updated during the `Commit Phase` of the `Fiber` architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Work-in-Progress Fiber Tree**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tree represents the new state of the application that is being built during the `Render Phase`. This tree is created based on the updated `React Elements` and is used to determine what changes need to be made to the `Actual DOM`. Once the `Render Phase` is complete, this tree becomes the new `Current Fiber Tree`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a component's state or props change, `React` creates a new `Work-in-Progress Fiber Tree` based on the updated `React Elements`. It then uses the `Diffing Algorithm` to compare the new tree with the previous `Current Fiber Tree` and determine what has changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when there's change `React` points the `Pointer` from `Current Fiber Tree` to `Work-in-Progress Fiber Tree` and starts the `Render Phase`. So, `Current Tree` becomes `Old Tree` and `Work-in-Progress Tree` becomes `New Tree`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is `Effect` in React Fiber?**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Effect` in `React Fiber` refers to the side effects that need to be performed after the `Render Phase` is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "These side effects can include things like updating the `DOM`, making network requests, or calling lifecycle methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, these `Effects` cannot be performed during the `Render Phase`, because they can cause changes to the `Fiber` tree, which would lead to an infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, `Effects` are tracked using a linked list of `Effect` objects. Each `Effect` object contains information about the type of effect (e.g., `Placement`, `Update`, `Deletion`), the `Fiber` node that the effect is associated with, and a pointer to the next effect in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If `Effects` cannot be performed during the `Render Phase`, then when are they performed?**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Effects` are performed during the `Commit Phase` of the `Fiber` architecture. Once the `Render Phase` is complete and the `Work-in-Progress Fiber Tree` has been fully built, `React` will then perform the necessary `Effects` to update the `Actual DOM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## **`Fiber` Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "`React` starts building `Fiber` tree from the root of the application. It creates a `Fiber` node for each `React Element` in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "It starts by calling `beginWork()` function on the root `Fiber` node. This function is responsible for starting the work on a `Fiber` node. And it keeps calling `beginWork()` on each child `Fiber` node until it reaches `Fiber` without child nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all the child `Fiber` nodes have been processed, it calls `completeWork()` function on the `Fiber` node. This function is responsible for completing the work on a `Fiber` node. And it keeps calling `completeWork()` on each parent `Fiber` node until it reaches the root `Fiber` node.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, `beginWork()` runs from `Top to Bottom` and `completeWork()` runs from `Bottom to Top`. Just like `Event Capturing` and `Event Bubbling` in `DOM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this work is done using `Work Loop` i.e. `while` loop (not recursive) which keeps calling `performUnitOfWork()` function until there is no more work to be done. This function is responsible for performing the work on a single `Fiber` node.\n",

    "## **Understanding `React` Compilation and Overall Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first make up our mind about what exactly happens when we write a `React` application.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we write a `React` application, we typically use `JSX` syntax to define our components. `JSX` is a syntax extension for `JavaScript` that allows us to write HTML-like code in our `JavaScript` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, browsers do not understand `JSX` syntax. Therefore, we need to compile our `JSX` code into plain `JavaScript` code that browsers can understand. This is typically done using a tool like `Babel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we compile our `JSX` code using `Babel`, it transforms the `JSX` syntax into `React.createElement()` calls. For example, the following `JSX` code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "const MyComponent = () => {\n",
    "  return <div>Hello, World!</div>;\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above `JSX` code is transformed into:\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "const MyComponent = () => {\n",
    "  return React.createElement(\"div\", null, \"Hello, World!\"); // Exactly replaced by Babel\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see the equivalent code for `JSX` by using the [Babel REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once our `JSX` code is transformed into `React.createElement()` calls, we can use it in our `React` application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what `React.createElement()` does is that it creates a `React Element` object. A `React Element` is a plain `JavaScript Object` that represents a DOM node or a component instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we console the `MyComponent` function, we will see that it returns an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "console.log(MyComponent());\n",
    "\n",
    "// Output:\n",

    "  key: null,\n",
    "  ref: null\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we `<MyComponent />` in our application, React will call the `MyComponent` function and use the returned object to create a DOM node.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Class Components**\n",

    "\n",
    "`Hooks` are special functions that allow you to use state and other `React` features in functional components. They were introduced in `React 16.8` to enable stateful logic in functional components, which were previously stateless.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Hooks? How Things Worked Before Hooks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before `Hooks`, if you wanted to use state or lifecycle methods, you had to use class components. This led to several issues:\n",

    "- **Complexity:** Class components can be more complex and harder to read than functional components, especially for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reusability:** It was difficult to reuse stateful logic between components, leading to code duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lifecycle Methods:** Class components have multiple lifecycle methods (e.g., `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount`), which can lead to scattered logic and make it hard to follow the flow of data.\n",

    "\n",
    "When the state or props of a component change, `React` triggers a re-render of the component. During this re-render, `React` creates a new `Tree` of `React Elements` based on the updated state and props.

    "\n",
    "When a component is rendered, `React` traverses the linked list of `Hooks` for that component instance and calls each `Hook` in order. This ensures that the state and lifecycle of the component are managed correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a state or props change occurs, `React` creates a new linked list of `Hooks` for the updated component instance.
