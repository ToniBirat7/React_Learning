    "## **Why NextJs if React is there?**\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "When we `build` the React app we get the two files i.e. `index.html` and `js` file. We deploy these two files. When the user requests the file first the `Js` file will be downloaded. \n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading, before the rendering starts; all the `useEffect` hooks starts to run to fetch the data from `API`. The issue here is that due to `useEffect` hooks the website loading time increases which directly effects the `SEO`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem we've `NextJs` framework. Remember `React` is a library not a framework. Also, the `React` official documentation also suggest us to use the `NextJs` framework when working with `React`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **NextJs Working**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no any difference in writing `React` code and `NextJs` code, internally `NextJs` uses `React` only. But the main difference lies in how the rendering takes place after the production `Build` of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "**React**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is client side rendering, all the heavy lifting is done on the client side. Actual `Js` runs on the client's browser due to which the rendering time increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "`React` uses `WebPack` bundler to build the project which is really `Slow`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`But`,\n",
    "\n",
    "**NextJs**\n",
    "\n",
    "In NextJs, the rendering takes on the `Server Side`. When a project is build all the data that is to be fetched or rendered in the client side is loaded and put in the final `HTML` and `CSS` file only which reduces all the burden for the client browser to load the data and improves performance as well as `SEO`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in `React` when we want to `route` between pages we need to use `ReactRouterDom` but in the `NextJS` we've a built in support for `Routing` of the pages. It uses the `File System` for routing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Supports both `CSR` and `SSR`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`NextJs` uses `Rust` for bundling which is really fast. \n",
    "\n",
    "`NextJs` was built by `Vercel.com` therefore we can host any `NextJs` project for free in `Vercel.com`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`NextJs` provides optimizations for `Images` `Fonts` and `Scripts` to improve the performance. "

    "\n",
    "They've the ability to run tasks like reading files or fetching data from a database. \n",

    "However, they do not have the ability to use hooks or handle user interactions \n",
    "\n",
    "**Client Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a Client component, it's necessary to add `use client` at the top of the component file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Client components can't perform tasks like reading files, but they have the ability to use hooks and manage interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are traditional React Components. \n",

    "### **Routing in NextJs**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Next.js` has a file system based routing mechanism. URL paths that users can access in the browser are defined by files and folders in your codebase. \n",
    "\n",
    "As NextJs is a framework so we will need to follow it's conventions to implement the features it provides. One of the feature is `File` based routing. Having said that we need to know that not every file in our project is `Routable`. Only those files that are inside the `app` folder are `Routable`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Routing Conventions**\n",
    "\n",
    "All routes must be placed inside the `app` folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every file that corresponds to a Route must be named `page.js` or `page.tsx`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every folder corresponds to a path segment in the browser URL. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Creating Routes**\n",
    "\n",
    "To create `Routes` we need to create a dedicated folder for each route inside the `app` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I want `localhost:3000/about` then we will need to have a folder `about` inside this folder there should be a `page.tsx` file for routing. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we request for `localhost:3000/dashboard` i.e. does not have Route then we will get a 404 page.  \n",
