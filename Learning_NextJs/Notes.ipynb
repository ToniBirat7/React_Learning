    "## **Why NextJs if React is there?**\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "When we `build` the React app we get the two files i.e. `index.html` and `js` file. We deploy these two files. When the user requests the file first the `Js` file will be downloaded. \n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading, before the rendering starts; all the `useEffect` hooks starts to run to fetch the data from `API`. The issue here is that due to `useEffect` hooks the website loading time increases which directly effects the `SEO`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem we've `NextJs` framework. Remember `React` is a library not a framework. Also, the `React` official documentation also suggest us to use the `NextJs` framework when working with `React`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **NextJs Working**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no any difference in writing `React` code and `NextJs` code, internally `NextJs` uses `React` only. But the main difference lies in how the rendering takes place after the production `Build` of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "**React**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is client side rendering, all the heavy lifting is done on the client side. Actual `Js` runs on the client's browser due to which the rendering time increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "`React` uses `WebPack` bundler to build the project which is really `Slow`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`But`,\n",
    "\n",
    "**NextJs**\n",
    "\n",
    "In NextJs, the rendering takes on the `Server Side`. When a project is build all the data that is to be fetched or rendered in the client side is loaded and put in the final `HTML` and `CSS` file only which reduces all the burden for the client browser to load the data and improves performance as well as `SEO`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in `React` when we want to `route` between pages we need to use `ReactRouterDom` but in the `NextJS` we've a built in support for `Routing` of the pages. It uses the `File System` for routing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Supports both `CSR` and `SSR`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`NextJs` uses `Rust` for bundling which is really fast. \n",
    "\n",
    "`NextJs` was built by `Vercel.com` therefore we can host any `NextJs` project for free in `Vercel.com`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`NextJs` provides optimizations for `Images` `Fonts` and `Scripts` to improve the performance. "
