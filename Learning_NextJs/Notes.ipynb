    "When we `build` the React app we get the two files i.e. `index.html` and `js` file. We deploy these two files. When the user requests the file first the `Js` file will be downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading, before the rendering starts; all the `useEffect` hooks starts to run to fetch the data from `API`. The issue here is that due to `useEffect` hooks the website loading time increases which directly effects the `SEO`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem we've `NextJs` framework. Remember `React` is a library not a framework. Also, the `React` official documentation also suggest us to use the `NextJs` framework when working with `React`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **NextJs Working**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no any difference in writing `React` code and `NextJs` code, internally `NextJs` uses `React` only. But the main difference lies in how the rendering takes place after the production `Build` of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**React**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is client side rendering, all the heavy lifting is done on the client side. Actual `Js` runs on the client's browser due to which the rendering time increases.\n",

    "\n",
    "`But`,\n",
    "\n",
    "**NextJs**\n",
    "\n",
    "In NextJs, the rendering takes on the `Server Side`. When a project is build all the data that is to be fetched or rendered in the client side is loaded and put in the final `HTML` and `CSS` file only which reduces all the burden for the client browser to load the data and improves performance as well as `SEO`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in `React` when we want to `route` between pages we need to use `ReactRouterDom` but in the `NextJS` we've a built in support for `Routing` of the pages. It uses the `File System` for routing.\n",

    "## **Understanding Routing in NextJs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we understand about routing in we need to under `React Server Components(RSC)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **React Server Component**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a new architecture introduced by the React team in version 18 which was quickly embraced by Next.js\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture introduces a new way of creating React Components, splitting them into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Server Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "In NextJs all components are Server components by Default\n",
    "\n",
    "They've the ability to run tasks like reading files or fetching data from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, they do not have the ability to use hooks or handle user interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Client Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a Client component, it's necessary to add `use client` at the top of the component file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client components can't perform tasks like reading files, but they have the ability to use hooks and manage interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are traditional React Components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Routing in NextJs**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Next.js` has a file system based routing mechanism. URL paths that users can access in the browser are defined by files and folders in your codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "As NextJs is a framework so we will need to follow it's conventions to implement the features it provides. One of the feature is `File` based routing. Having said that we need to know that not every file in our project is `Routable`. Only those files that are inside the `app` folder are `Routable`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Routing Conventions**\n",
    "\n",
    "All routes must be placed inside the `app` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every file that corresponds to a Route must be named `page.js` or `page.tsx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every folder corresponds to a path segment in the browser URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Creating Routes**\n",
    "\n",
    "To create `Routes` we need to create a dedicated folder for each route inside the `app` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I want `localhost:3000/about` then we will need to have a folder `about` inside this folder there should be a `page.tsx` file for routing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we request for `localhost:3000/dashboard` i.e. does not have Route then we will get a 404 page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Nested Routes**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want `localhost:3000/blog` then `localhost:3000/blog/first`. We will need to create sub directories with their corresponding `page.jsx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that each new folder inside the `app` folder is equivalent to a `URL` segment i.e. unique routing option.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dynamic Routing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now we've only static routing but there are scenarios where our URL becomes dynamic. For example `localhost:3000/products/1`. We need to handle such cases with Dynamic Routing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a dynamic routing folder we use the `[]` to name the folder. In our case we want accept the `product/id` therefore any parameter that will be sent to the matching path will capture the `id` by the Component that is defined in that path as `props`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "export default function Product({ params }: { params: { productId: string } }) {\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "      <h1>Product Id {params.productId}</h1>\n",
    "      <p>Product details will be displayed here.</p>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./Notes_Image/I1.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, since NextJs uses `TypeScript` therefore we need to be careful about the using and defining types in Ts while using props or any other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code `{\n",
    "  params,\n",
    "  }: { \n",
    "    params: { productId: string };\n",
    "}` we are defining the type for the `props` object which has a key `productId` with it's type `string`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Nested Dynamic Routing**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example we want `localhost:3000/product/1/review/1` then we will need to use the Nested Dynamic Routing.\n",

    "This error occurs because in `Next.js` `App` Router (app/ directory), route parameters (params) are `asynchronous` when using dynamic segments like [productId] and [reviewId]. You must define your page component as an async function to await these params properly.\n",

    "Here’s how to fix it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Js\n",
    "\n",
    "import { type Metadata } from \"next\";\n",
    "\n",
    "type Props = {\n",

    "    productId: string;\n",
    "    reviewId: string;\n",
    "  };\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "export default async function Review({ params }: Props) {\n",
    "  const { productId, reviewId } = await Promise.resolve(params);\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "      <h1>\n",
    "        Review {reviewId} for Product {productId}\n",
    "      </h1>\n",
    "      <p>Product review will be displayed hereeeeeeeeeeeee.</p>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**But Why Do We Need To Use Async Await??**\n",
    "\n",
    "As, NextJs uses a combination of `SSR`, `SSG` and `ISR` and any folder or file inside the `app` is treated as a `Server Component` by default, which means that it can contain server-side logic like database queries, API calls and parameter resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, Dynamic Parameters like `[productId]` are provided asynchronously because the server needs to `fetch`, `process` and `validate` these parameters, especially when we use nested routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "By making these process `Asynchronous`, `Next.js` can handle multiple requests simultaneously, reducing the server response time. As these tasks are `I/O` bound tasks therefore for better performance we must make these functions `Asynchronous`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Catch-all Segments**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we are developing a documentation website, we will have many features with each having many sub concepts. If we were to manage the routing for every single sub content there will be a huge number of files for each routing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases we use Catch-all segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./Notes_Image/I2.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do it by defining a single Dynamic Routing File.\n",

    "Used to logically group our routes and project files without affecting the URL path strcucture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to understand with the Authentication Route i.e. Login, Register etc\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first soulution would be to create separate folders for each of the Authentication task. Yes we can do that but it does not improve the readability of the our project for other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead what we can do is we can create a parent directory i.e. `auth` and move our previously created folders inside this folder. It works and a new URL segement gets added to our URL path i.e. `localhost:3000/auth/login`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here is a problem, why do we need `auth` in our `URL` path when we do not have any file that is specific to `localhost:3000/auth/` we will get a `404` page error.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this we've `Route Groups`, to make our `auth` folder Route Group we can enclose the name of the folder with `()` i.e. `(auth)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we won't need to include `auth/` in our URL path to access any of the Authentication feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Layouts**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Page` : It is a UI that is unique to a route. It means that for each route we have a page i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "A layout is a UI that is shared between multiple pages in the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Create Layouts**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create layout by default exporting a `React` component from a `layout.js` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "That component should accept a children prop that will be populated with a child page during rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "`NextJs` by default provides a root `layout.tsx` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we visit `localhost:3000` the `layout.tsx` file accepts the root `page.tsx` file in the `children` props.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main feature of the `layout.tsx` is that the static decleration remains consistent even when the URL changes. Only the Dynamic content in the `childern` props is rendered based on the URL path.\n",
    "\n",
    "This unique feature makes the `SS` and `CS` rendering possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Nested Layout**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to create a separate UI for a specific routing segment we need to create `layout.tsx` file inside the URL segment folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, If I want for a layout for `[productid]` segment then we will need to create `layout.tsx` as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Js\n",
    "\n",
    "export default function ProductDetailsLayout({\n",
    "  children,\n",
    "}: {\n",
    "  children: React.ReactNode;\n",
    "}) {\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <>\n",
    "      {children}\n",
    "      <h2>Features Products</h2>\n",
    "    </>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, when we request for `product/1` our component defined in the `page.tsx` with in this `[productid]` is passed as `children` prop in the above layout componet.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the above `ProductDetailsLayout` is passed as `children` props in our root `layout.tsx` page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Route Group Layout**\n",
    "\n",
    "We previously used the route groups to organize our project in a manner that doesn't affect the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we can also apply Route Groups to selectively apply a layout to certain segments while leaving others unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we created the `auth` folder as Route Group what if we want to create a separate `layout` to include `Login` and `Register` page and exclude `forgot_pass` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we can do it we can put the `Login` and `Register` inside another folder with the `Route` Groups implemented and define the `layout` page for this `Route` Group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when we visit `http://192.168.1.79:3000/login` we can see the `layout.tsx` implementation only for the `login` and `register` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Routing Metadata**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are building any web application ensuring proper SEO is crucial for increasing visibility and attracting users.\n",
    "\n",
    "For such, `Next.js` introduced the Metadata API which allows you to define metadata fro each page. This Routing metadata ensures accurate and relavant information is dispalyed when our pages are shared or indexed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two methods i.e. `Layout` or `Page` file. Also, either export a static `MetaData` object or Export a Dynamic Metadata function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before Using Metadata, We need to Understand These Things**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` can export metadata. If defined in a layout, it applies to all pages in that layout, but if defined in a page, it applied only to that page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata is read in order, from the root level down to the final page level.\n",
    "\n",
    "When there's metadata in multiple places for the same route, they get combined, but page metadata will replace layout metadata if they have the same properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the root `layout.tsx` we've\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "export const metadata = {\n",
    "  title: \"My First App\",\n",
    "  description: \"This is my first app using Next.js 13.4\",\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and in the `/about` `page.tsx` we've\n",
    "\n",
    "```Js\n",
    "export const metadata = {\n",
    "  title: \"About CodeWithBirat\",\n",
    "  description: \"We are in the Auth Page\",\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, title we be created as `<title>` tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are exporting `metadata` in both the files, but `page.tsx` will take the precedence.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<meta name=\"description\" content=\"We are in the Auth Page\">` when inspecting the `/about` page.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, in the `localhost:3000` our metadata is `<meta name=\"description\" content=\"This is my first app using Next.js 13.4\">`\n",
    "\n",
    "This was about `Static` metadata now we'll learn about Dynamic Metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Metadata**\n",
    "\n",
    "Depends on dynamic information such as current route parameters, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a `Dynamic Metadata` we will use a `GenerateMetaData` function that will return a object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We only use dynamic metadata only with the `Dynamic Route`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `product/1` is a unique product which should have it's own name in the `<title>`. This is where we can use the `GenerateMetaData` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our `product/[productId]` and `page.tsx` we implemented the below code for the Dynamic Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "```Ts\n",
    "import { Metadata } from \"next\";\n",
    "import { title } from \"process\";\n",
    "\n",
    "export const generateMetadata = async ({\n",
    "  params,\n",
    "}: Props): Promise<Metadata> => {\n",
    "  const { productId } = await Promise.resolve(params);\n",
    "  return {\n",
    "    title: `Product ${productId}`,\n",
    "  };\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "type Props = {\n",
    "  params: {\n",
    "    productId: String;\n",
    "  };\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "export default async function Product({ params }: Props) {\n",
    "  const { productId } = await Promise.resolve(params);\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "      <h1>Product Id {productId}</h1>\n",
    "      <p>Product details will be displayed here.</p>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of the function should be `generateMetadata` only. This function takes `params` of type `Props` and `returns` `Promise<Metadata>` object.\n",
